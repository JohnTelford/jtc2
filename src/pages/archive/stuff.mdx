“JSX combines the JS from JavaScript and the X from XML. It is a JavaScript extension that allows us to define React elements using a tag-based syntax directly within our JavaScript code. ”

Excerpt From: Alex  Banks. “Learning React.” Apple Books. 

“JSX provides us with a nice, clean way to express React elements in our code that makes sense to us and is immediately readable by developers. The drawback of JSX is that it’s not readable by the browser. Before our code can be interpreted by the browser, it needs to be converted from JSX into JavaScript.”
