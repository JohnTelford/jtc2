# Web Technology Summary

## Hardware

Web site development is not easy and is time consuming. Optimizing the development environment is critical

The key hardware for web developers are workstations. They need to be robust, reliable, secure, fast, support large screens, be supported, and work with web software development applications:

## Software

Web development time is expansive. 

### Develop Locally

Developing web software using local development workstations and software is advantageous. The development environment is not locked into   vendor cloud services.  They can be updated with new and improved hardware and software quicker than relying on vendor cloud service to update


### Development Frameworks

Web development frameworks are local web site generators running on development workstations. They abstract other technologies, helping make developing web sites faster and more robust. The output is deployed to vendor cloud-based web services, eliminating the need for local web servers. The result is browsers render web pages by interrupting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript instructions generated by development frameworks.

### Source Code Editor

Choosing a source code editor that is the local project development Central Command and Control stack running on developers workstations is an advantage. It is a fast and convent way to create, track changes, test, maintain, and deploying project web sites 
 
Quickly invoking live preview while editing source code is a time saver. It show how edits will be displayed on the web. Quickly deploying separate secure development and regular production updates to the web, enables project stake holders to quickly view development  and production progress, and make improvement suggestions.  

### Version Control System

Version control helps answer the questions; *who changed what, where, when, and why?*

``Git`` is a  distributed version control system running on developer workstations for coordination with other developers and tracking  project file changes.

*GitHub* is an online web hosted repository for ``git`` projects. It is a platform for hosting versions of project files in a remote repository that is a unified source of truth for all developers.
