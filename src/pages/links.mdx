A labyrinth symbolizes  there may be difficulties  reaching  web  project goals. Knowledge and experience with web technology disciplines  may help.

Business focus, marketing messages, customer needs, and other factors usually  require  web site updates.

This site discusses leveraging component web  technologies and software engineering practices that optimize creating, updating and maintaining web sites to reducing overall costs.

Tracking web technologies has been a passion since the early days of the Internet. I enjoy learning ever changing Electronics, Internet, and Software technologies with hands-on experience of interesting technologies du jour.
