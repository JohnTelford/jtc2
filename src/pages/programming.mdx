# Web Programming

Web programming is not easy, time consuming, and expensive. Optimizing the web development environment is critical.


## Web Programming Languages

***

### Hypertext Markup Language

[HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)  is the standard markup language for Web pages. It defines the content and structure of web pages. HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.


### JavaScript

[JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)  is a high-level language, flexible and expressive enough to write web applications. It has many advantages. It is dynamically typed, requires no compile step, and has a huge ecosystem that provides powerful frameworks, libraries, and other tools. JavaScript   is one of the core technologies of  web site programming. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. All contemporary web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript virtual machine built in to execute it.

### JSX

[JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper) (JavaScript XML)  is a statically-typed, object-oriented programming language. It is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It enables write HTML   in JavaScript. JSX converts HTML tags into React elements.

### CSS

[CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML

CSS instructs  browsers  how elements are to be styled and rendered.

### Markdown

John Gruber published the original Markdown Syntax Guide. Different flavors of Markdown have evolved since then.

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) is a better way to write HTML. It is compiled into HTML at deploy time. Markdown is a lightweight  plaintext  markup language   used to add formatting elements to  documents. Markdown is now one of the world’s popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different from using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file. Markdown syntax is added to the text to indicate which words and phrases look different.

Markdown has been characterized by an informal specification and a reference implementation for conversion to HTML. Over time, many Markdown implementations have appeared. People developed is driven by the need for additional features like  tables, footnotes, definition lists, and HTML inside Markdown blocks. The behavior of these additional features diverge from the reference implementation  and informal specification, and have attracted attention

### MDX

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is markdown for the component era. It enables seamlessly writing JSX in Markdown documents. It is compiled to JSX components, It enables using markdown’s terse syntax (such as # heading) and JSX for more advanced components.
