# Web Programming Languages

## Hypertext Markup Language


HTML  is the standard markup language for Web pages. It defines the content and structure of web pages. HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.


## JavaScript


JavaScript  is a high-level language, flexible and expressive enough to write web applications. It has many advantages. It is dynamically typed, requires no compile step, and has a huge ecosystem that provides powerful frameworks, libraries, and other tools. JavaScript   is one of the core technologies of  web site programming. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. All contemporary web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript virtual machine built in to execute it.

## JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It enables write HTML elements in JavaScript. JSX converts HTML tags into React elements.


## Markdown


John Gruber published the original Markdown Syntax Guide. Different flavors of Markdown have evolved since then.

Markdown is a better way to write HTML. It is compiled into HTML at deploy time. Markdown is a lightweight  plaintext  markup language   used to add formatting elements to  documents. Markdown is now one of the world’s popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different from using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file. Markdown syntax is added to the text to indicate which words and phrases look different.

Markdown has been characterized by an informal specification and a reference implementation for conversion to HTML. Over time, many Markdown implementations have appeared. People developed is driven by the need for additional features like  tables, footnotes, definition lists, and HTML inside Markdown blocks. The behavior of these additional features diverge from the reference implementation  and informal specification, and have attracted attention


## reStructuredText

reStructuredText is a lightweight markup language that is used in static site generators like Sphinx [#]_. Sphinx requires using Markdown or reStructuredText for text material editing. This web site is an example of using reStructuredText and Spninx. 

Sphinx contains robust tools for semantic markup, reusing content, and content filters for different kinds of outputs.

Compared to some other lightweight markup languages like MarkDown, reStructuredText contains stronger semantic markup tools. Writers prefer reStructuredText because the markup standards are more well-defined compared to MarkDown

reStructuredText is an easy-to-read,  plaintext markup syntax and parser system. It is useful for quickly creating simple web pages, and for standalone documents

Structured Text" is a misnomer. It is” Relaxed Text" that uses certain consistent patterns. These patterns are interpreted by a HTML converter to produce  Structured Text" that can be used by a web browser

reStructuredText is the default plaintext markup language for Sphinx

Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing and translating suite, the Docutils.
