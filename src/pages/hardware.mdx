# Development Hardware

***

Web site development is not easy and is time consuming. Optimizing the development environment is critical.

The key hardware for web developers are workstations. They need to be reliable, secure, fast, support large screens, supportable, and work with web software development applications

The contemporary choice for web development workstations are Apple, Linux, and Microsoft.  I have experience building web sites with purchased and bare metal Microsoft systems and bare metal Linux systems. I use apple products for exploring Internet technologies and creating web sites.
 
Traditionally these companies built workstation products with Intel processors. They are diversifying their product line with ARM-based processors

## Apple


Apple recently released the first Mac products built with the ARM-based, Apple silicon designed,  processors, and the macOS Big Sur operating system engineered to use   M1 chip capabilities. 

The last processor transition Apple had was from the Motorola 68000 to the Intel x86. It took time for Apple vendors and users to modify their software to run on the x86. Apple created the Rosetta translation application that ran Motorola 68000 binary code on x86 machines.  The M1 translation layer Rosetta 2, is about 80% the speed of the of native Apple Silicon code. The single-core Rosetta 2 benchmark running on a low end M1 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM,  is faster than  other x86 Mac machines in single core benchmark. The M1 MacBook Air running native is faster than any competitors top of the line x86 machine, except for a couple.

The key hardware for web developers are workstations. They need to be robust, reliable, secure, fast, supportable, and support large screens. Apple products prices could be higher than their competitors. It is mitigated by the quality of hardware and software, robustness, security, and vendor support. 

Apple is a computer manufacturing company delivering workstation  products with  Apple developed macOS certified UNIX operating  systems. The advantages of Apple products are robustness, reliability, security, speed, vendor hardware and software support, and relative ease to use. Apple has responsibility for maintaining hardware and software products from sale to retirement.  Apple Stores  are equipped to  diagnose and repair Apple products. 

Any unnecessary web developer workstation downtime is expensive. Apple products  have a  premium price. It is mitigated  over time with robustness,  reliability, fewer securities issues, vendor support, and Apple Stores. 

Operating systems updates have been free for years, and Apple  continues to have the highest customer satisfaction in the industry.

## Linux

Linux  is an examples of free and open-source software collaboration. The source code may be used, modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses

Linux is the leading operating system on servers. Its greatest success in the consumer market is mobile device. Android being one of the dominant smartphones Linux-based operating system

There are a few Linux vendor  supported hardware platforms or Linux software distributions. The diversity of Linux distributions means that not all software or hardware runs on all distributions or applications. Packaged software and software repositories are specific to a particular distribution

Not all peripheral device vendors support Linux. The Linux open-source community supplies several missing device drivers.

The price of Linux-based systems is attractive. The operating system software is free. Ready-made hardware platforms are available, or can be built by choosing hardware and software components, and having the skills to assemble and maintain it.

The reliability, robustness,  security, and supportability of Linux systems varies from low to high, depending on the knowledge and skills of the builders and maintainers

Responsibility for maintaining Linux workstation hardware, operating systems, and device drivers  is fragmented or doesn't exist, except  from the builders and maintainers

There are computer repair shops that  are equipped to diagnosed and repaired Linux systems, but not to the extent of Apple Stores

## Microsoft

Microsoft is a software development company. Microsoft *Windows*  is a proprietary graphical operating system developed and marketed by Microsoft. Windows is the most used operating system  on personal computers desktops, laptops,  and game consoles.

Many  companies sell  hardware platforms with   Microsoft Windows  installed. Many peripheral device vendors  support Windows drivers.

Consumer versions of Windows were originally designed for ease-of-use on a single-user PC without a network connection, and did not have security features built in from the outset. Windows updates are regularly improving security.

Windows is one of hackers prime  data hunting grounds, even with frequent security updates. Windows systems are everywhere and stores or has  access to vast amounts of data. There are Windows installations that  do not keep Windows updated. One reason may be  issues with updates. Microsoft Windows update problem 2021 and are  recent examples

The reliability, robustness,  security, and supportability of Microsoft systems varies from low to high, depending on the knowledge and skills of the builders, maintainers, hardware, and vendors. The combinations and permutations of vendor hardware platforms, software applications, and peripheral vendors and device support, may be contributing to Microsoft Windows update problems


There are computer repair shops that  are equipped to diagnosed and repaired Windows systems, but not to the extent of Apple Stores
