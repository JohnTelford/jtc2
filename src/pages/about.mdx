# About


The web has been a part of my life since its early days. I have years of learning ever changing Electronics, Internet, and Software technologies by hands-on experiencing the technologies du jour.

 I have a passion pursuing what’s new and improved with these industries. Checking out what’s new or not, a pipe dream or not, or what’s new and improved, is like panning for gold. Buried within the mountains of info rubble produced daily, every so often one finds  nuggets making the effort worthwhile.

I am an Electronics and Software Engineer specializing in web technology architecture, development, deployment, and maintenance
