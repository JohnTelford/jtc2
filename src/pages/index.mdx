*JohnTelford.com LLC* is a web technology consulting company working with client  web development projects. I am the sole proprietor of the company.

I am an Electronics and Software Engineer specializing in web hardware and software technology disciplines:

- Architecture
- Development
- Deployment

A labyrinth symbolizes  there may be difficulties  reaching  web  project goals. Knowledge and experience with web technology disciplines  may be helpful.

Business focus, marketing messages, customer needs, and other factors usually  require  web site updates.

Some companies are not interested in how their web sites are constructed â€” as long as they have the features and functionality needed to satisfy their target market. The cost of not being interested may cost a magnitude or more for updating and maintaining  web sites than development costs.

This site discusses leveraging component web  technologies and software engineering practices to optimize creating, updating and maintaining web sites and reducing overall costs.
