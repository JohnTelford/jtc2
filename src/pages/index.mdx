## Develop Locally


Developing web software using local development hardware and software is advantageous. The   hardware and software are not locked into   vendor cloud services. One can respond to new and improved web development hardware and software quicker than relying on vendor cloud service to update

## Hardware

Web site development is not easy and is time consuming. Optimizing the development environment is critical

The key hardware for web developers are workstations. They need to be reliable, secure, fast, support large screens, supportable, and work with web software development applications:


## Development Frameworks

Web development frameworks are web site generators abstracting other technologies, helping make developing web sites faster and more robust. The output of site generators are deployed to vendor cloud-based web services, eliminating the need for local web servers. The end result is browsers interrupting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript instructions, and rendering web pages



## Software

Web development time is expansive. Choosing a source code editor that is also the project development stack Central Command and Control for creating, testing, maintaining, and deploying web sites is an advantage.
 
Quickly invoking live preview while editing is a time saver, and shows how the edit will be displayed on the web


## Deploy Globally

Deploy using an Application Delivery Network (ADN) vendor cloud service that provides continuous web deployment  worldwide to every major cloud provider:



## Version Control System

Version control helps answer the questions; who changed what, where, when, and why?

``Git`` is a  distributed version control system  for tracking  project file changes.


   
*GitHub* is an online web hosted repository for `git` projects. It is a platform for hosting versions of most type of project files in a remote repository that is a unified source of truth
