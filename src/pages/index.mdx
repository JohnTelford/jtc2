*JohnTelford.com LLC* is a web technology consulting company working with client  web development projects. I am the sole proprietor of the company.

I am an Electronics and Software Engineer specializing in web hardware and software technology disciplines:

- Architecture
- Development
- Deployment

A labyrinth symbolizes  there may be difficulties  reaching  web  project goals. Knowledge and experience with web technology disciplines  may help.

Business focus, marketing messages, customer needs, and other factors usually  require  web site updates.

Some companies are not interested in how their web sites are constructed â€” as long as it has all the features and functionality needed to satisfy their target market. The cost of updating  and maintaining  web sites may be a magnitude or more than the cost of developing them.

Leveraging web technologies and software engineering practices that optimize creating, updating and maintaining web sites reduce overall costs.

## Technology

Tracking web technologies has been a passion since the early days of the Internet. I enjoy learning ever changing Electronics, Internet, and Software technologies with hands-on experience of interesting technologies du jour.
